Action potential prediction simulation recorded the following notes:
 * Warning: the credible intervals here (from lookup tables) do not align with simulation - treat them with caution. This may be because they are computed for steady state and you are running for a limited pacing time. If you are running for a long time (hundreds of paces) and still getting this warning then let us know and we can try to refine the Lookup Table.
