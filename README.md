## Requirements

Processing and plotting the simulation data in this repository requires installation of python 3 and certain libraries within. We recommend installing packages and running the scripts in a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts. In order to do this, follow these steps:

- `virtualenv folder_name` or if you have both python 2 and 3: `virtualenv --python=python3 folder_name`. Should `virtualenv` not be recognised you may need to call it as `python -m virtualenv folder_name` or (`python -m virtualenv folder_name`). If that doesn't work you may need to install virtualenv first `pip install virtualenv`.
- go into the virtual environment `cd folder_name` folder
- activate `source ./bin/activate` (or `Scripts\activate` on Windows)
- now get the source code from git: `git clone https://github.com/DGWhittaker/risk-stratification-anti-malarials.git`
- install the required packages by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages

## Generating the data

The simulations in this paper use the ApPredict tool (see [here](https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/wiki/ApPredict) for installation instructions). In order to generate the data used in the paper, after installing ApPredict and docker run the following commands from within a virtual environment:

- `docker run -it appredict-no-emulators:brute_force /bin/bash`
- `cd apps/ApPredict/`

We also recommend activating a screen session if using Linux as it may take many hours to generate the simulation data, which are produced by typing a command which tells ApPredict which ion channels to block and by which amount for each drug/combination. For example, the data for hydroxychloroquine are generated by typing

- `./ApPredict.sh --model 8 --pacing-freq 0.5 --pic50-herg 5.25 --pic50-spread-herg 0.139 --pic50-cal 4.57 --pic50-spread-cal 0.181 --pic50-iks 5.03 --pic50-spread-iks 0.127 --plasma-conc-high 100 --plasma-conc-count 19 --plasma-conc-logscale True --no-downsampling True --credible-intervals 60 70 80 90 95 --brute-force 1000 --output-dir HCQ &> testoutput/HCQ.txt &`

which runs the simulation in detached mode and stores the console output in `testoutput/HCQ.txt`. For a full list of the commands used to generate the data see `commands.txt`. For convenience we have stored all of the simulation data in `testoutput`.

## Plotting the figures

In order to generate Figure 1 from the paper, simply type:
`python Figure1.py` (or `python3 Figure1.py` if you have both python 2 and 3 installed).
Figures 2 and S1 can be rendered using the same command.

The figures used in the paper can be found in [Figures/](./Figures).
